This repository contains a collection of small Verilog projects I've undertaken to learn and explore the Verilog hardware description language. These projects cover various aspects of digital design, including:

Combinational Logic:

Adders/Subtractors

Multiplexers

Decoders/Encoders

Comparators

Sequential Logic:

Registers (e.g., D-flip-flop, JK-flip-flop, T-flip-flop)

Counters (e.g., up/down counter, modulo-N counter)

Shift Registers (e.g., serial-in/serial-out, parallel-in/parallel-out)

Finite State Machines (FSMs)

Also some of these files include solutions for the problem set in HDL bits.
