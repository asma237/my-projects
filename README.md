This repository contains a collection of small Verilog projects I've undertaken to learn and explore the Verilog hardware description language. These projects cover various aspects of digital design, including:
Combinational Logic:
Adders/Subtractors
Multiplexers
Decoders/Encoders
Comparators
Sequential Logic:
Registers (e.g., D-flip-flop, JK-flip-flop, T-flip-flop)
Counters (e.g., up/down counter, modulo-N counter)
Shift Registers (e.g., serial-in/serial-out, parallel-in/parallel-out)
Finite State Machines (FSMs)
Each project will be organized in its own dedicated folder.
Each project folder will contain:
Verilog source files (.v): Containing the Verilog code for the design.
Testbench files (.v): Containing testbenches to verify the functionality of the design.
